Landing Page – The Odin Project

This repository contains my solution to The Odin Project – Landing Page assignment.

The goal of this project was to practice HTML, CSS, and Flexbox by recreating a landing page based on a provided design.

- What I Built

A Formula 1–themed landing page

A hero section with title, description, call-to-action button, and image

A drivers section showcasing legendary F1 drivers with stats

Image credits and proper accessibility with alt text

- What I Practiced

Semantic HTML structure

CSS styling fundamentals

Flexbox layout (alignment, spacing, and positioning)

Image handling and basic layout organization

Writing a clean README and proper attributions

Note: This project is designed for desktop view only, as required by the assignment.
